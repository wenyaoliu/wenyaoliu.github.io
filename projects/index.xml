      <description>**Note: The project is undergoing and some details cannot be provided.**Introduction This undergoing project aims to reveal traffic patterns in sensor data from thousands of connected vehicles in Oklahoma and investigate their correlation with roadway crashes.
Methods  Using Apache Spark for processing and filtering the big data sets (489 GB in total). Visualized vehicle data with ArcGIS and identified traffic and crash data hot spots. Building CNN-based deep learning models and Bayesian hierarchy models (BHM) for predicting roadway crashes based on corresponding vehicular data.</description>

      <description>**Note: The project is undergoing and some details cannot be provided.**  Introduction Accurately measure the traffic speed on pavement network it is vital to decision making in transportation system. Four speed measurment systems are available in Oklahoma and their compabilty is unknown.
Featured results 1. Viualize the site/segment in different systems  Fig. 1 Speed measurement location comparisons
 2. Compare the similarity between 4 systems site by site  Fig. 2 Similarity factors between 4 systems site by site (-1 to 1, with 1 as the best)</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peridynamics model was applied to simulate SCB testing for asphalt mixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cracking patterns in simulation match lab observations well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fracture energy and P-u curve from simulation agrees with experimental results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arch effect and energy transformation during SCB testing were investigated.&lt;/li&gt;
